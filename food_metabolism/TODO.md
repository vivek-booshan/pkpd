## Lauren & Ella
- I need units for everything in the gut, document them in the respective parameters.py and Index.py function
- get realistic values for parameters and initial concentrations (just order of magnitude like 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, etc)
- I know you spangler gals are good at plotting so get me some plots of different food compositions and their effects on organs
    - glucose/fats/nutrients across organs
    - all the components in EACH organ
    - any interesting behaviors you guys are interested in

## Noam
- Help Lauren & Ella with above
- Show different dieting style effects on a day of metabolism (american sugary vs keto vs carnivore etc)
- Make up a breakfast, lunch, and dinner example and then do a repeated dose test over the course of 24 hours
    - (a week if it's easy enough for you to set up different meals (each meal should be a function that initializes the y0 values))
    - basically run a system for a certain amount of time, take the output of that simulation and then add the y0 of the next meal to it and then rerun simulation
    - test the effect of different fasting styles
